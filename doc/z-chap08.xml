    <Heading> Dual semigroups </Heading>
    The <E>dual semigroup</E> of a semigroup <C>S</C> is the semigroup with the
    same underlying set of elements but with reversed multiplication; this is
    anti-isomorphic to <C>S</C>. In &SEMIGROUPS; a semigroup and its dual
    are represented with disjoint sets of elements.

      Strong semilattices of semigroups
    </Heading>

    In this section, we describe how &SEMIGROUPS; can be used to create and
    manipulate strong semilattices of semigroups (SSSs).
    Strong semilattices of semigroups are described, for example, in Section
    4.1 of <Cite Key = "Howie1995aa"/>.
    They consist of a meet-semilattice <M>Y</M> along with a collection of
    semigroups <M>S_a</M> for each <M>a</M> in <M>Y</M>, and a collection of
    homomorphisms <M>f_{ab} : S_a \rightarrow S_b</M> for each <M>a</M> and
    <M>b</M> in <M>Y</M> such that <M>a \geq b</M>.
    <P/>

    The product of two elements <M>x \in S_a, y \in S_b</M> is defined to lie
    in the semigroup <M>S_c</M>, corresponding to the meet <M>c</M> of
    <M>a, b \in Y</M>. The exact element of <M>S_c</M> equal to the product
    is obtained using the homomorphisms of the SSS: <M>xy = (x f_{ac})
    (y f_{bc})</M>.

  <Section Label = "McAlister triple semigroups">

      McAlister triple semigroups
    </Heading>
    In this section, we describe the functions in &GAP; for creating and
    computing with McAlister triple semigroups and their subsemigroups.
    This implementation is based on the section in Chapter 5 of
    <Cite Key = "Howie1995aa"/> but differs from the treatment in Howie
    by using right actions instead of left. Some definitions found in
    the documentation are changed for this reason. <P/>

    The importance of the McAlister triple semigroups lies in the fact that
    they are exactly the E-unitary inverse semigroups, which are an important
    class in the study of inverse semigroups. <P/>

    First we define E-unitary inverse semigroups. It is standard to
    denote the subsemigroup of a semigroup consisting of its idempotents by
    <C>E</C>. A semigroup <C>S</C> is said to be <E>E-unitary</E> if for all
    <C>e</C> in <C>E</C> and for all <C>s</C> in <C>S</C>:

    <List>
      <Item>
        <C>es</C> <M>\in</M> <C>E</C> implies <C>s</C> <M>\in</M> <C>E</C>,
      </Item>
      <Item>
        <C>se</C> <M>\in</M> <C>E</C> implies <C>s</C> <M>\in</M> <C>E</C>.
      </Item>
    </List>

    For inverse semigroups these two conditions are equivalent. We are only
    interested in <E>E-unitary inverse semigroups</E>.
    Before defining McAlister triple semigroups we define a McAlister triple.
    A <E>McAlister triple</E> is a triple <C>(G,X,Y)</C> which consists of:

    <List>
      <Item>
          a partial order <C>X</C>,
        </Item>
        <Item>
            a subset <C>Y</C> of <C>X</C>,
          </Item>
          <Item>
            a group <C>G</C> which acts on <C>X</C>, on the right, by order
            automorphisms. That means for all <C>A,B</C> <M>\in</M> <C>X</C> and
            for all <C>g</C> <M>\in</M> <C>G</C>: <C>A</C> <M>\leq</M> <C>B</C> if
              and only if <C>Ag</C> <M>\leq</M> <C>Bg</C>.
            </Item>
          </List>

          Furthermore, <C>(G,X,Y)</C> must satisfy the following four properties to
          be a McAlister triple:

          <List>
            <Mark> M1 </Mark>
            <Item>
              <C>Y</C> is a subset of <C>X</C> which is a join-semilattice together
                with the restriction of the order relation of <C>X</C> to <C>Y</C>.
              </Item>
              <Mark> M2 </Mark>
              <Item>
                <C>Y</C> is an order ideal of <C>X</C>. That is to say, for all <C>A</C>
                <M>\in</M> <C>X</C> and for all <C>B</C> <M>\in</M>
                <C>Y</C>: if <C>A</C> <M>\leq</M> <C>B</C>, then <C>A</C> <M>\in</M>
                <C>Y</C>.
              </Item>
              <Mark> M3 </Mark>
              <Item>
                Every element of <C>X</C> is the image of some element in <C>Y</C> moved
                  by an element of <C>G</C>. That is to say, for every <C>A</C> <M>\in</M>
                  <C>X</C>, there exists some <C>B</C> <M>\in</M> <C>Y</C> and there exists
                  <C>g</C> <M>\in</M> <C>G</C> such that <C>A</C> = <C>Bg</C>.
                </Item>
                <Mark> M4 </Mark>
                <Item>
                  Finally, for all <C>g</C> <M>\in</M> <C>G</C>, the intersection
                  <C>{yg : y </C><M>\in</M><C> Y}</C> <M>\cap</M> <C>Y</C> is non-empty.
                </Item>
              </List>

              We may define an E-unitary inverse semigroup using a McAlister triple. Given
              <C>(G,X,Y)</C> let <C>M(G,X,Y)</C> be the set of all pairs <C>(A,g)</C> in
              <C>Y x G</C> such that <C>A</C> acted on by the inverse of <C>g</C> is in
              <C>Y</C> together with multiplication defined by <P/>

              <C>(A,g)*(B,h) = (Join(A,Bg^-1),hg)</C> <P/>

              where <C>Join</C> is the natural join operation of the semilattice and
              <C>Bg^-1</C> is <C>B</C> acted on by the inverse of <C>g</C>. With this
              operation, <C>M(G,X,Y)</C> is a semigroup which we call a <E>McAlister
              triple semigroup</E> over <C>(G,X,Y)</C>. In fact every McAlister triple
              semigroup is an E-unitary inverse semigroup and every E-unitary inverse
              semigroup is isomorphic to some McAlister triple semigroup. Note that there
              need not be a unqiue McAlister triple semigroup for a particular McAlister
              triple because in general there is more than one way for a group to act on
              a partial order.

      Translations and translational hulls
    </Heading>
    In this section we describe the functionality in Semigroups for working with
    translations of semigroups. The notation used (as well as a number of
    results) is based on <Cite Key="Petrich1970aa"/>. Translations are of
    interest mainly due to their role in ideal extensions. A description of
    this role can also be found in <Cite Key="Petrich1970aa"/>.  The
    implementation of translations in this package is only applicable to
    finite semigroups.
    
    For a semigroup <M>S</M>, a transformation <M>\lambda</M> of <M>S</M>
    (written on the left) is a left translation if for all <M>s, t</M> in
    <M>S</M> <M>\lambda (s)t = \lambda (st) </M>.<P/>

    A right translation <M>\rho</M> (written on the right) is defined 
    dually.<P/>

    The set <M>L</M> of left translations of <M>S</M> is a semigroup under 
    composition of functions, as is the set <M>R</M> of right translations.<P/>

    The associativity of <M>S</M> guarantees that left [right] multiplication by
    any element <M>s</M> of <M>S</M> represents a left [right] translation;
    this is the <E>inner</E> left [right] translation <M>\lambda_s</M>
    [<M>\rho_s</M>].  The inner left [right] translations form an ideal in
    <M>L</M> [<M>R</M>].<P/>

    A left translation <M>\lambda</M> and right translation <M>\rho</M> are
    <E>linked</E> if for all <C>s, t</C> in <M>S</M>,
    <M>s\lambda(t) = (s)\rho t</M>.<P/>

    A pair of linked translations is called a <E>bitranslation</E>. The set of
    all bitranslations forms a semigroup <M>H</M> called the <E>translational
    hull</E> of <M>S</M> where the operation is componentwise. If the
    components are inner translations corresponding to multiplication by
    the same element, then the bitranslation is <E>inner</E>. The inner
    bitranslations form an ideal of the translational hull.

    <Heading>
        Translations of normalised Rees matrix semigroups
    </Heading>
    Translations of a normalized Rees matrix semigroup
    <M>T</M> (see <Ref Attr = "RMSNormalization"/>) over a group <M>G</M> 
    can be represented through certain tuples, which can be computed 
    very efficiently compared to arbitrary translations. For left translations
    these tuples consist of a function from the row indices of <M>T</M> to G and
    a transformation on the row indices of <M>T</M>; the same is true of right
    translations and columns. More specifically, given a normalised Rees matrix
    semigroup <M>S</M> over a group <M>G</M> with sandwich matrix <M>P</M>, rows
    <M>I</M> and columns <M>J</M>, the left translations are
    characterised by pairs <M>(\theta, \chi)</M> where <M>\theta</M> is a
    function from <M>I</M> to <M>G</M> and <M>\chi</M> is a transformation of
    <M>I</M>. The left translation <M>\lambda</M> defined by 
    <M>(\theta, \chi)</M> acts on <M>S</M> via</P>

    <M>\lambda((i, a, \mu)) = ((i)\chi, (i)\theta \cdot a, \mu)<M>.</P>

    where <M>i</M> is in <M>I</M>, <M>a \in G</M>, and <M>\mu> is in 
    <M>J</M>. Dually, right translations <M>\rho</M> are characterised by
    pairs <M>(\omega, \psi)<M> where <M>\omega</M> is a function from
    <M>J</M> to <M>G</M> and <M>\psi</M> is a transformation of
    <M>J</M>, with action given by</P>
    
    <M>((i, a, \mu))\rho = (i, a \cdot (\mu)\psi, (\mu)\psi)</M>.</P>

    Similarly, bitranslations <M>(\lambda, \rho)</M> of <M>S</M> can be
    characterised by triples <M>(g, \chi, \psi)</M> such that <M>g \in G</M>,
    <M>\chi</M> and <M>\psi</M> are transformations of <M>I, J</M> respectively,
    and</P>

    <M>p_{\mu, (i)\chi} \cdot g \cdot p_{(1)\psi, i} = 
       p_{\mu, (1)\chi} \cdot g \cdot p_{(mu)\psi, i}</M>.</P>

    The action of <M>\lambda</M> on <M>S</M> is then given by</P>
    
    <M>\lambda((i, a, \mu)) =
       ((i)\chi, b \cdot p_{(1)\psi, i} \cdot a, \mu)</M>,</P>

    and of <M>\rho</M> on <M>S</M> by</P>

    <M>((i, a, \mu))\rho =
       (i, a \cdot p_{\mu, (1)\chi} \cdot b, (\mu)\psi)</M>.</P>
